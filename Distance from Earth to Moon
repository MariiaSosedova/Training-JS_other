Nowadays astronomers with the help of modern instruments with a laser beam can determine the distance between the Earth and the Moon with an accuracy of several centimeters. 
On one of the observation days the Moon approached the Earth at a distance of distance cm. 
Calculate this distance in meters and kilometers rounding the results to the nearest whole number.

Write a function named distanceToMoon that takes a distance (distance in centimeters) as an argument and returns an array [distanceInKm, distanceInMeters].

Example:

distanceToMoon (38020012375) should return [380200, 380200124].

Solution:

function distanceToMoon(distance){
  let m = Math.round(distance / 100);
  let km = Math.round(distance / 100000);
  return [km, m];
}
