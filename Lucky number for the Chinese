Eight is the luckiest number for all Chinese people. Sounds like "wealth" and "prosperity."

The Chinese are very often willing to pay huge sums of money for a phone number car number or apartment number in which the number 8 is present. 
In addition the shape of the eight resembles an infinity sign and therefore the Chinese associate the eight with a never-ending flow of money.

An array containing numbers is given. Get an array of numbers containing the digit 8.

Write a function named luckyChineseNumber that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns an array of Chinese lucky numbers, 
i.e. numbers containing the digit 8.

Examples:

luckyChineseNumber ([124, 18, 13, 8, 81, 182, 11]) should return [18, 8, 81, 182]

Solution:

function luckyChineseNumber(numbers){
  let arr = [];
  for(let el of numbers) {
  if ((el+'').includes('8')) arr.push(el);
  }
  return arr;
}

OR

function luckyChineseNumber(numbers){
  return numbers.filter(el => (el +'').includes('8'));
}
