The word has been given. Get the word by reading it from right to left i.e. turn that word over.
Write a function called reverseWord that takes word as an argument and returns a string containing the reversed word. 
The reverse () method is not allowed in this job.

Examples:

reverseWord ("abc")  must return "cba";
reverseWord ("No") must return "oN" `.

Solution:

function reverseWord(word){
  let str = '';
  for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    str += word[word.length - 1 - i];
  }
  return str;
}
