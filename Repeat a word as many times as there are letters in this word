The word has been given. Repeat the word as many times as there are letters in this word.

Write a function named repeatWord that takes 'word' as an argument and returns a string containing the word repeated as many times as there are letters in that word. 
Separate words with spaces. There is no space after the last word.

Examples:

repeatWord ("a") return "a";
repeatWord ("No") return "No No";
repeatWord ("One")  return "One One One";
repeatWord ("Five")  return "Five Five Five Five"

Solution:

function repeatWord(word){
  return (word + ' ').repeat(word.length).trim();
}
