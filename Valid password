The function receives a string containing the password. A valid password is at least 7 characters long. 
If the password contains less than 7 characters, the function pads it on the right with "$" characters up to 7 characters.

Write a function named validPassword that takes the string password as an argument and returns a string right-padded with "$" characters 
if the password is less than 7 characters long or the original string if the password is 7 characters or more.

Examples:

validPassword ("abc") should return "abc $$$$";
validPassword ("Null") must return "Null $$$";
validPassword ("Qwertyu") should return "Qwertyu";
validPassword ("VeryStrongPassword123456") return "VeryStrongPassword123456"

Solution:

function validPassword(password){
return password.length >= 7 ? password : password + '$'.repeat(7-password.length);
}
